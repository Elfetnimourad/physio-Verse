          Understanding the Universe
        </h3>

          The universe is vast, mysterious, and filled with secrets yet to be
          uncovered. Every theory we create brings us closer to understanding
          the fabric of reality â€” the nature of time, space, energy, and matter.
          As humanity, we are destined to explore, to question, and to expand
          our vision beyond the stars.

        <p className="fst-italic mb-4 text-center">
          As Galileo once looked through his telescope to expand our vision,  
          we too must scale the scope of our understanding to see the universe.
